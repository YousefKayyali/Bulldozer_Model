# Bulldozer Price Prediction Model

## Project Overview
This project is focused on building a predictive model for bulldozer prices using historical data. The model is trained using various regression techniques including Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Linear Regression.

## Features
- **Data Visualization**: Utilizes Matplotlib and Seaborn for exploratory data analysis.
- **Model Training**: Employs RandomForestRegressor, DecisionTreeRegressor, and LinearRegression.
- **Model Optimization**: Applies RandomizedSearchCV for optimizing model parameters.
- **Model Evaluation**: Uses metrics like Mean Squared Log Error and Mean Absolute Error for evaluating model performance.
